# Unit 11 - Risky Business
Mortgages, student and auto loans, and debt consolidation are just a few examples of credit and loans that people seek online. Peer-to-peer lending services such as Loans Canada and Mogo let investors loan people money without using a bank. However, because investors always want to mitigate risk, a client has asked that you help them predict credit risk with machine learning techniques.

In this assignment I built and evaluated several machine learning models to predict credit risk using data you'd typically see from peer-to-peer lending services. Credit risk is an inherently imbalanced classification problem (the number of good loans is much larger than the number of at-risk loans)
